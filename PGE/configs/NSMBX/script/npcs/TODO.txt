- onBlockSpawn() event
  this event should be triggered when NPC just spawned and inited after kicking of NPC contained block
- onDead() event
  this event should be triggered when NPC dies

- Bossedit's idea with flower powerups:
        <bossedit8> so about my suggestion
        <bossedit8> remember in NSMBWII that once you play in multiplayers you get even more power ups from one single blocks as default
        <bossedit8> right?
        <Wohlstand> I.e. one block contains array of variouse NPC's
        <Wohlstand> just you can put into it any crap which you wanna include into it, and when you will hit it: everything will appear and... will chaze Mario xD
        <bossedit8> like once you put a fireflower in one block, in 2 players you get one mushroom and one fireflower if both of the players are small
        <Wohlstand> Oh, than another thing
        <Wohlstand> same fireflower, but if two players are detected and second player is small - spawn mushroom too
        <Wohlstand> I.e. will be spawned TWO npc's: mushroom and flower
        <Wohlstand> right?
        <Wohlstand> it will a  small lua-side script
        <bossedit8> yeah
        <Wohlstand> is not hard
        <bossedit8> 1 player's status is small = mushroom
        <Wohlstand> but a good idea :)
        <bossedit8> 2 player's status is big = fireflower
        <Wohlstand> I need to add lua event "onBlockSpawn"
        <bossedit8> ok
        <Wohlstand> where I will check common status and will transform NPC into ...mushroom if both players are small
        <Wohlstand> ..will spawn both flower and mushroom if one of players is small but other - big and more
        <Wohlstand> and flower only if both players are big or greater
        <Wohlstand> I think, everything is right :)
        <Wohlstand> and... especially for NPC suggestions I will make separated todo.txt file directly in the npcs folder where actual scripts are placed
        <bossedit8> In NSMBWii however, you actually get one greater power up (fireflower) even if all characters are small
        <bossedit8> everyone except one gets mushrooms
        <bossedit8> that's how NSMBWii did
        <bossedit8> aswell
        <Wohlstand> some lua tricks per NPC will do more wonderful thins even this when I checked out it in my thinks
        <bossedit8> ok
