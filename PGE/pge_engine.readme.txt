Requirements:
==============================================
- Operating system:
  + Linux x86/x64 kernel version 2.6 and higher

- OpenGL 3.x compatible video card with 128 MB Video RAM and higher

==============================================
Adding Episodes
==============================================
To add episode to be able play it with engine, find the "worlds" folder
=== Linux ===
On the UNIX-like operating system worlds folder can be found at home in the special folder
        ~/.PGE_Project/worlds
Note: If you have portable version, "worlds" folder will be in same folder with pge_engine application file

=== Windows ===
On the Windows Operating system it will have this path:
        %UserProfile%\.PGE_Project\worlds
Note: If you have portable version, "worlds" folder will be in same folder with pge_engine application file

=== Mac OS X ===
On the Mac OS X worlds folder always locating in the special folder:
        ~/Library/Application Support/PGE Project
Note: you will found a shortcut "Data folder" in the folder with PGE installation since you will launch PGE apps first time.

==============================================
Adding Levels
==============================================
Levels which are listing in the "Play level" menu are must be placed in the "worlds" folder without subfdolers
while episodes are in their subfolders

==============================================
Note: If you want have everything in SAME folder like in the SMBX, create "pge_engine.ini" file with next contents:
----------------------------
[Main]
force-portable=true
----------------------------
And everything: worlds, screenshots, logs will be stored in same folder where pge_engine application is located.
[will not work with Mac version. Use "Data Directory" symlink to get data folder!]
==============================================

You should be up to date with any configuration packages,
there are in dev-state: I fixing old mistakes, misses, adding new important features which
should be presented in your ini files of each config pack. Else you may get wrongs and more bugs
because wrong config settings.
