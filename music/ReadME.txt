Notes about MIDI files:

1) all MIDI-files are uses "loopStart" and "loopEnd" tags which
are understandable by ADLMIDI sequencer or by Final Fantasy VII game.
Those files are will not be playd accurate in regular media players
without implementation of "loopStart" and "loopEnd" support.

2) I'm not recommend you to use FL Studio to edit those MIDI Files,
because it usually loses tempo tag, therefore those MIDI-files are
will be played in some players (include ADLMIDI) are will be played
in 100 ticks per second tempo.

If you still wish use FL Studio, you cloud fix your FL Studio-made
MIDI-files with simple re-saving in the MidiEditor software which
you can take here: http://midieditor.sourceforge.net/
